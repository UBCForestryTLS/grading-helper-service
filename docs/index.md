# Welcome

These are the official documentation for the UBC Faculty of Forestry [AI Grading Helper](https://github.com/forestrytls/grading-helper-service/)

!!! note 

    This interactive documentation is generated using the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Inspiration to write these
* I anyways like to write documentation :)
* Helps me to be clear about design decisions
* Helps prevent [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep)
* Might help future developers
* Nice to look at

!!! Important

    Although the mindful use of GenAI is not only fine but encouraged, kindly avoid updating these docs using GenAI. Writing it yourself will be beneficial.
