# Project Origins & Motivation

## Why are we making this project?

The TLS Large TLEF team; namely me (Akshat), Fabian, Frederick and Michelle had a meeting with an instructor for CONS 127 and NRES 241 and a senior TA for FRST 303 and FRST 304 for an initial consultation discussion on the GenAI course assistant project where we discussed our vision for the project and gathered feedback and any requests they had.

!!! example "The FRST 304 Challenge"
    A senior TA for FRST 303 and FRST 304 reported that:
    
    - Each TA grades **~400 exams** per term
    - Grading time: **~80 hours** per TA, per course

## Who is this project for?

* For both instructors and TA's of Forestry courses.
* Specially for courses that spend a large amount of TA time on grading.


## What is gonna make this valuable?

1. **Statistical Validation**
2. **Instructor Trust**
3. **Time Savings**
4. **Student Feedback**


# User Stories

!!! note ""
    Simple statements what the users are able to do with the application (Ideally non technical statements)

**Core Grading**

* As a grader, I want to upload a batch of student submissions and get AI-generated grades, so that I can reduce my grading time

* As a grader, I want to see the AI's rubric-aligned feedback for each student, so that I can verify it before releasing grades

* As a grader, I want to edit AI-generated feedback before finalizing, so that I can add personal touches or corrections

* As a grader, I want to override AI grades when I disagree, so that I maintain control over final grades

**Quality & Trust**

* As a grader, I want to flag AI grades as "approved" or "needs review", so that I can track my quality control progress

*  As a grader, I want to estimate grading costs before submitting a batch, so that I can budget appropriately
