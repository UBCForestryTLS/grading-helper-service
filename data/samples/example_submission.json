  "student_response": "Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with tree roots. The fungi help trees by increasing their ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, especially phosphorus which is often limited. In return, the trees provide the fungi with sugars produced through photosynthesis. This relationship is found in most forest ecosystems and is essential for tree health. For example, many pine trees cannot survive without their mycorrhizal partners, and the fungi can also help protect trees from some root diseases.",
